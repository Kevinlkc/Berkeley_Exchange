"0","# The more Dimensions Kept in the Model of PLSR, the more unstable the coefficients are. There's an expanding effect. (The same logic follows for the more flexible a model is, the more variance it will generate. And also for PCR.) The coefficients could blow up in some circumstances, that's even more severe in PLSR than PCR. Note that the coefficients when # = 10 is identical to the coefficients of the OLS regression."
