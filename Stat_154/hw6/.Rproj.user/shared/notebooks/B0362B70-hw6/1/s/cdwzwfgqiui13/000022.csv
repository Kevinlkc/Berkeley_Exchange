"0","# The more Principal Components Kept in the Model, the more unstable the coefficients are. There's an expanding effect. (The same logic follows for the more flexible a model is, the more variance it will generate.) The coefficients could blow up in some circumstances, possibly due to multicolinearity. Note that the coefficients when # = 10 is identical to the coefficients of the OLS regression."
