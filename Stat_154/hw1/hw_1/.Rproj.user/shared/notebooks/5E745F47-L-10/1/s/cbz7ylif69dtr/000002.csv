tlmgr using installation: /usr/local/texlive/2018
TeX Live (http://tug.org/texlive) version 2018
"
"2","Detected an existing tlmgr at /Library/TeX/texbin/tlmgr. It seems TeX Live has been installed (check tinytex::tinytex_root()). You are recommended to uninstall it, although TinyTeX should work well alongside another LaTeX distribution if a LaTeX document is compiled through tinytex::latexmk()."
